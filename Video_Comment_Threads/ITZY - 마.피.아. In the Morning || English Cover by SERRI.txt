ITZY - 마.피.아. In the Morning || English Cover by SERRI


@SERRI  2021-04-30T11:49:16Z:
Edit: <b>So, apparently people still don&#39;t get that my english covers are not supposed to be a translation but a rewrite. What people also don&#39;t understand is the fact that CC translations on MV&#39;s aren&#39;t meant to be sung like that my gosh. If you wanna act smart at least be smart enough to read literally the first sentence in my description before commenting stuff that will just make you look stupid</b> 

Original pinned comment: So, I actually liked this more than I expected I was really unsure when I listened to the album spoilers but I&#39;m sure it will grow on me. I can not get over the visuals of the MV though and also Lia&#39;s vocals really sound soo soo good here! I mean they all sounded good .. love how they can literally do it all and slay it all.
