ITZY - 'WANNABE' [ENGLISH VERSION] Lyrics [Color Coded_Eng],"I think most Kpop songs' English versions are more straightforward, like u can barely see any metaphors or slangs or indirect lyrics like originally English songs. And some parts just sound so awkward, the number of syllables in the translated lines didn't match up that resulted to some rushed words or some just have some pauses to fill out the missing syllables. And some lyrics or terms just sound so cringe for a song",UgzASpQyT3mx6LJbdWB4AaABAg,UCqqQ3_CPqC1vIQx6sGnfWcw,Sung Jin-Woo,4569,2021-01-22T05:21:17Z

I felt like Lia in Not shy slipped soo many beats, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a technique or something but I didn&#39;t liked any of lia&#39;s verses in Not shy and also Yeji&#39;s . Ryujin and Chaeryeong was okay. In wannabe I don&#39;t think anybody sounded best beside Yuna. And I am not really having the lyrics. It&#39;s just I don&#39;t think we can even call them lyrics.
