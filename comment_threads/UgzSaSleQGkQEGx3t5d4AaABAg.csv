"ITZY ""SNEAKERS (English Ver.)"" Lyric Video  @ITZY ‚Äã",This has to be like one of the best English translated kpop songs existed like did you guys hear those flows and those rhymes? Like that pre-chorus is sooo nice. Really kudos to their English translators and kudos to Itzy members too for working hard with their English pronunciations and communication skills üëè üëè üëè,UgzSaSleQGkQEGx3t5d4AaABAg,UC6FbIcILSh2L6nY7Zx-PHRw,fox rain // truth hurts certain narratives,1236,2022-07-18T15:08:59Z

"ITZY ""SNEAKERS (English Ver.)"" Lyric Video  @ITZY ‚Äã","I don‚Äôt think they really needed to translate much. I get impression from how perfectly the rhyming couplets are that the song was probably written in English originally, then had bits translated into Korean for the main release.<br><br>The writers of the song aren‚Äôt Korean and it‚Äôs pretty common for songs to be written with a guide English lyric before being rewritten in Korean. If you lay out the lyrics of the Korean version there‚Äôs actually not much Korean in it lol<br><br>Itzy have done really well with their songs I think, in terms of having both Korean and English versions that work well without being clunky. They are, along with (G)I-dle, I think some of the best at it right now.",UgzSaSleQGkQEGx3t5d4AaABAg,UC8jDqCZr9Tmbf3z431W5Oww,Doug,106,2022-07-18T15:31:58Z
"ITZY ""SNEAKERS (English Ver.)"" Lyric Video  @ITZY ‚Äã",@Clingy BishAlready listened to them all the moment they came out and the only one I really truly enjoy was probably Mafia in the Morning. Others felt a bit forced like I&#39;m still questioning why they picked to lead their English releases with Not Shy lol. Like Not Shy is one of my fav title track from Itzy but the English ver fell kinda flat for me personally &amp; this one is actually pretty good so  :)),UgzSaSleQGkQEGx3t5d4AaABAg,UC6FbIcILSh2L6nY7Zx-PHRw,fox rain // truth hurts certain narratives,18,2022-07-18T15:32:38Z

"ITZY ""SNEAKERS (English Ver.)"" Lyric Video  @ITZY ‚Äã",Thing is the origional English lyrics where probably more mature and current but Koreans may not understand them so they may need to simplify them so globally they can be understood and pronounced well by the artist.
