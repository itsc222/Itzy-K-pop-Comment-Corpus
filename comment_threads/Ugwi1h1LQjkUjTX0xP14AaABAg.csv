ITZY - 'NOT SHY' [ENGLISH VERSION] Lyrics [Color Coded_Eng],"I like how they actually do their best to pronounce the words as clearly as they can, especially Yeji. As we all real ITZY fans know that Yeji's English is not as fluent as Lia Chaeryeong or Ryujin but she still slayed her parts clearly. I'm genuinely so proud of them as a whole.",Ugwi1h1LQjkUjTX0xP14AaABAg,UCYk2vFWYP7-uY_PZrSOWhnQ,JimBob Smith Jr.,1077,2021-01-22T15:21:30Z
